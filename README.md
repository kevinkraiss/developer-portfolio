# Developer Portfolio
This is a collection of recent completed projects placed into a portfolio page.

The purpose of this page is to give potential employers a way to acces material I have worked on in class. 

Placeholders are in use for my resume, contact info, and projects 3-5. Right now, they are jsut linked to the most recent project. I will be able to update them as we complete more work.
