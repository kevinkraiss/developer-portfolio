# developer-portfolio
This is a collection of recent completed projects placed into a portfolio page.

The purpose of this page is to give potential employers a way to acces material I have worked on in class. 

Placeholders are in use for my resume, contact info, and projects 3-5. I will be able to update them as we complete more work.

Below is a screenshot of the portfolio:
